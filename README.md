# Raddit

This is the practice application made and planned by [mackenziechild](https://github.com/mackenziechild/raddit), and the article is [here](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/1/).

In this application, we can:

* Post links with title
* Upvote and downvote for a link
* Leave comments

From this application, we can learn:

* How to make a quick setup with scaffold
* How to use "bootstrap"
* How to make a simple back-end that allow users create and destroy their own post and comments.
* How to construct a vote mechanism with "acts_as_votable"

## Specs
* ruby: 2.2.2
* rails: 4.2.6
